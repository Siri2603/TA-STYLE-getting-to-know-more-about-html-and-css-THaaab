          <p>
            AI generally is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and
            data analytics.[5] Machine learning takes data and looks for
            underlying trends. If it spots something that is relevant for a
            practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and
            use it to analyze specific issues. All that is required are data
            that are sufficiently robust that algorithms can discern useful
            patterns. Data can come in the form of digital information,
            satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data.

          <h3>Adaptability</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            AI systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make
            decisions. In the transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous
            vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about
            upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other
            possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the
            experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement,
            and the entire corpus of their achieved “experience” is immediately
            and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their
            advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in
            current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to
            present information in real time so human drivers are able to make
            sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case
            of fully autonomous vehicles, advanced systems can completely
            control the car or truck, and make all the navigational decisions.

          <h3>Finance</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Investments in financial AI in the United States tripled between
            2013 and 2014 to a total of $12.2 billion.[9] According to observers
            in that sector, “Decisions about loans are now being made by
            software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data
            about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background
            check.”[10] In addition, there are so-called robo-advisers that
            “create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for
            stockbrokers and financial advisers.”[11] These advances are
            designed to take the emotion out of investing and undertake
            decisions based on analytical considerations, and make these choices
            in a matter of minutes.

          <h3>National security</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            AI plays a substantial role in national defense. Through its Project
            Maven, the American military is deploying AI “to sift through the
            massive troves of data and video captured by surveillance and then
            alert human analysts of patterns or when there is abnormal or
            suspicious activity.”[15] According to Deputy Secretary of Defense
            Patrick Shanahan, the goal of emerging technologies in this area is
            “to meet our warfighters’ needs and to increase [the] speed and
            agility [of] technology development and procurement.”.
