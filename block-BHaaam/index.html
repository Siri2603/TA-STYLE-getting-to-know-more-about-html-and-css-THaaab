            Most people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial
            intelligence (AI). As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business
            leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17
            percent said they were familiar with it.[1] A number of them were
            not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular
            companies. They understood there was considerable potential for
            altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be
            deployed within their own organizations.
          </p>

            Despite its widespread lack of familiarity, AI is a technology that
            is transforming every walk of life. It is a wide-ranging tool that
            enables people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze
            data, and use the resulting insights to improve decisionmaking. Our
            hope through this comprehensive overview is to explain AI to an
            audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers,
            and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world and raising
            important questions for society, the economy, and governance.

            In this paper, we discuss novel applications in finance, national
            security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart
            cities, and address issues such as data access problems, algorithmic
            bias, AI ethics and transparency, and legal liability for AI
            decisions. We contrast the regulatory approaches of the U.S. and
            European Union, and close by making a number of recommendations for
            getting the most out of AI while still protecting important human
            values.

          <h3>I. QUALITIES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Although there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally
            is thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation
            consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human
            capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”[3] According to
            researchers Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make
            decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise” and
            help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come
            up.[4] As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and
            adaptive manner.

          <h3>II. APPLICATIONS IN DIVERSE SECTORS</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            AI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here
            today and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of
            sectors. This includes fields such as finance, national security,
            health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities.
            There are numerous examples where AI already is making an impact on
            the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.
