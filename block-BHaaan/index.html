            The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by
            the world and considered a national treasure in China. This bear
            also has a special significance for WWF because it has been our logo
            since our founding in 1961.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of
            southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They
            must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what
            part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist
            bones that function as opposable thumbs.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th
            the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds,
            while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears
            are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Today, WWF protects wild pandas by preventing habitat loss caused by
            human development and encroachment, the most serious threat to their
            long-term survival. For years, led by WWF-China and now with new
            partners including Disneynature, we’ve worked to preserve and link
            important panda corridors across China, spanning more than 34
            million acres, three provinces, and two of the country’s largest
            river basins. In the process, we’ve protected critical habitat for
            other species too: snub-nosed monkeys, takins, and snow leopards
            among them.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The efforts are yielding success: Wild panda numbers are finally
            rebounding after years of decline. In September, the International
            Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced that pandas have
            been upgraded from “endangered” to “vulnerable” on the global list
            of species at risk of extinction, following a population growth of
            nearly 17% over the past decade. Yet while this recent status change
            for pandas is encouraging, they’re not out of the woods yet. Says Lo
            Sze Ping, CEO of WWF-China, “Everyone should celebrate this
            achievement. But pandas remain scattered and vulnerable, and much of
            their habitat is threatened by poorly planned infrastructure
            projects. Remember, there are still only 1,864 left in the wild.”

            The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and
            short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes.
            The male’s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies
            between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely
            lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy,
            covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing
            onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some
            lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the
            cat a majestic appearance. Manes make males look larger and may
            serve to intimidate rivals or impress prospective mates. A
            full-grown male is about 1.8–2.1 metres (6–7 feet) long, excluding
            the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder
            and weighs 170–230 kg (370–500 pounds). The female, or lioness, is
            smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of
            0.9–1.1 metres, and a weight of 120–180 kg. The lion’s coat is short
            and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray
            to dark brown, with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker
            than the rest of the coat.

            Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride.
            The members of a pride typically spend the day in several scattered
            groups that may unite to hunt or share a meal. A pride consists of
            several generations of lionesses, some of which are related, a
            smaller number of breeding males, and their cubs. The group may
            consist of as few as 4 or as many as 37 members, but about 15 is the
            average size. Each pride has a well-defined territory consisting of
            a core area that is strictly defended against intruding lions and a
            fringe area where some overlap is tolerated. Where prey is abundant,
            a territory area may be as small as 20 square km (8 square miles),
            but if game is sparse, it may cover up to 400 square km. Some prides
            have been known to use the same territory for decades, passing the
            area on between females. Lions proclaim their territory by roaring
            and by scent marking. Their distinctive roar is generally delivered
            in the evening before a night’s hunting and again before getting up
            at dawn. Males also proclaim their presence by urinating on bushes,
            trees, or simply on the ground, leaving a pungent scent behind.
            Defecation and rubbing against bushes leave different scent
            markings.
